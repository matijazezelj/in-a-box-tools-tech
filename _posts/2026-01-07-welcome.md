After 25 years in infrastructure, I've seen the same story play out hundreds of times: smart teams spending weeks configuring observability and security tooling instead of building features.

It doesn't have to be this hard.

## What We're Building

**In a Box Tools** is a collection of production-ready infrastructure stacks you can deploy with one command:

- **[OIB - Observability in a Box](/products/oib/)** — The complete Grafana LGTM stack. Logs, metrics, traces, and profiling, all pre-configured with dashboards.

- **[SIB - SIEM in a Box](/products/sib/)** — Runtime security monitoring with Falco, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and fleet management.

Each product follows the same philosophy:

1. **One command** — Clone, configure, `make install`. Done.
2. **Opinionated defaults** — Production-grade configuration out of the box.
3. **No vendor lock-in** — 100% open source, your infrastructure, your data.
4. **Self-contained** — Everything runs in Docker.

## What's Next

We're working on expanding the "In a Box" family:

- **NIB** — Network monitoring in a Box
- **DIB** — Database observability in a Box
