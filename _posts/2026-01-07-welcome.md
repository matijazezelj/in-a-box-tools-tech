description: "Introducing our family of open source infrastructure tools — and why we're building them."

After 25 years in infrastructure, I've seen the same story play out hundreds of times: smart teams spending weeks configuring observability and security tooling instead of building features.

It doesn't have to be this hard.

## What We've Built

**In a Box Tools** is a collection of production-ready infrastructure stacks you can deploy with one command:

- **[OIB - Observability in a Box](/products/oib/)** — The complete Grafana LGTM stack. Logs, metrics, traces, and profiling, all pre-configured with dashboards.

- **[SIB - SIEM in a Box](/products/sib/)** — Runtime security monitoring with Falco, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and fleet management.

- **[SIB-K8s - SIEM in a Box for Kubernetes](/products/sib-k8s/)** — Kubernetes-specific security monitoring with multi-cloud audit support and Helm chart deployment.

- **[NIB - NIDS in a Box](/products/nib/)** — Network intrusion detection with Suricata IDS, CrowdSec automated blocking, and community threat intelligence.

- **[AIB - Assets in a Box](/products/aib/)** — Infrastructure asset discovery and dependency mapping. Parse Terraform, Kubernetes, and Ansible to understand what depends on what.

Each product follows the same philosophy:

1. **One command** — Clone, configure, `make install`. Done.
2. **Opinionated defaults** — Production-grade configuration out of the box.
3. **No vendor lock-in** — 100% open source, your infrastructure, your data.
4. **Self-contained** — Everything runs in Docker (or a single Go binary for AIB).

## What's Next

We're working on expanding the "In a Box" family:

- **DIB** — Database observability in a Box
- **BIB** — Backup and disaster recovery in a Box
